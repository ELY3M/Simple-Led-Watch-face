# Simple-Led-Watch-face


recently, I got new fossil 6 watch off of ebay for cheap price.... 
but I hate round watch.  I am looking for new SQAURE watch.  
this was my old watchface.  I had to redo the size and positions to fit this stupid round watch. 

I think I will contact fossil to tell them to make square watch!!!!  
I still wearing old LG watch and I love this but it is getting outdated.
